# OWLTEH - Open Web for Learning & Teaching Expertise Hub

OWLTEH is an initiative that aims to gather resources and examples of inspiring practice related to the Open Web and its use for educational purposes. It is the result of the generosity of educators and learners who want to share their knowledge and experience of the Open Web, enabling others to understand and take advantage of its potential for learning and teaching.

The phrase ‘Open Web’ might be traced back to the original vision behind the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW), imagined by its creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee as “an open platform that would allow everyone, everywhere to share information, access opportunities, and collaborate across geographic and cultural boundaries.”

OWLTEH looks at online infrastructures that somehow enable this, with a particular focus on how they can be used within educational context.

You will like OWLTEH if you are interested in learning in a networked world and want to help your community (school, university, community organisation etc.) to develop their own web literacies.
