HOW CAN I GET INVOLVED?

There a two main types of contributions that will help OWLTEH develop:

- Instances of the Open Web: information about Open Web technologies, tools or platforms.
- Experiences of the Open Web: specific cases of how you have used the Open Web in teaching and learning. Ideally, this will include resources supporting other people to have a go at using your approach to teaching and learning on/with the Open Web, such as can workshop guidelines or discussion materials to help others to use and remix your approach.

If you would like to add a resource or example of how the Open Web can be used in teaching and learning, then get in touch via Twitter (@owlteh), email or our idea submission page {the two latter still work in progress}.

Help us grow and improve OWLTEH:
